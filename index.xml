      <description>Referred the Cardiovascular Disease dataset from Kaggle
  Built an ANN model to predict whether a person is suffering from cardiovascular disease or not
  Performed EDA and handled outliers present within the dataset
  Used Keras Tuner to optimize the hyperparameters of the ANN model
  Achieved :
 Training Accuracy = 99 % Testing Accuracy = 83 %     GitHub Link of the Project</description>

      <guid>https://gauravk1997.github.io/My-Data-Science-Portfolio/post/project-4/</guid>
      <description>Referred the Dissolved Oxygen Level in River Water dataset from Kaggle
  The dataset contained 37 discrete features, having majority of NaN values
  Dropped the features containing more than 60% of NaN values, and replaced the NaN values with the mean value of that feature for the important features
  Performed EDA and handled outliers present within the dataset
  Firstly solved the problem as a Regression setting and achieved RSquared value of 0.</description>

      <description>Referred the University Salaries dataset from Kaggle which included the base pay of the Professors from the University of Vermount (UVM) from 2009 to 2021
  The dataset contained 14470 records including no missing values
  Performed EDA and found out that there are no outliers present within the dataset
  Solved the problem using standard procedure as well as by using sklearn Pipeline</description>
